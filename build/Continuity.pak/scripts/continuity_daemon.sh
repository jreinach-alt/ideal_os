# sed, find, cmp and friends too, not just the shell dialect.

# fully self-tested exec falls through to the device shell. A missing,
# truncated, wrong-arch, or otherwise broken vendored binary must never
# take the daemon down with it — the device shell runs the daemon today
# and remains the safety net. launch.sh never uses the vendored
# interpreter at all: the bootstrap/recovery path stays device-native.
