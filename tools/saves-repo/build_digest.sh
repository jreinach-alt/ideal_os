# build_digest.sh — daily save-archive digest for a Continuity saves repo.
#
# Scans commits in a time window (default: the last 24 hours), groups
# archived files by the device that pushed them (the `device:` trailer
# Continuity writes in every sync commit), and emits a Markdown digest.
# Conflict artifacts (.local/.conflict) get their own attention section
# — the digest doubles as the safety net after a gameplay session.
#
# Runs inside the SAVES repo (see saves-digest.yml). POSIX sh; tested
# under BusyBox ash by the Continuity project's suite.
#
# Usage: sh build_digest.sh <output.md>
#   DIGEST_SINCE   override the window (default "24 hours ago")
#   Exit 0 with output written  -> save activity found, digest ready
#   Exit 1, no output           -> nothing archived in the window
